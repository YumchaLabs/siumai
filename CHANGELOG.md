# Changelog

## [0.8.0] (Not Released) - 2025-08-02

### Breaking Changes

- **Security and Reliability Improvements** - Introduced `secrecy` crate for secure API key handling, `backoff` crate for professional retry mechanisms.
- **Streaming Infrastructure Overhaul** - Replaced custom streaming implementations with `eventsource-stream` for professional SSE parsing and UTF-8 handling across all providers.

### Added

- OpenAI Responses API support (sync, streaming, background, tools, chaining)

### Fixed

- **URL Compatibility** - Fixed URL construction across all providers to handle base URLs with and without trailing slashes correctly, preventing double slash issues in API endpoints.
- **Anthropic API Compatibility** - Fixed Anthropic API max_tokens requirement by automatically setting default value (4096) when not provided, resolving "max_tokens: Field required" errors.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-08-02

### Fixed

- **Code Quality and Documentation** - Fixed all clippy warnings, documentation URL formatting, memory leaks in string interner and optimized re-exports to reduce namespace pollution
- **Tool Call Streaming** - Fixed incomplete tool call arguments in streaming responses. Previously, only the first SSE event from each HTTP chunk was processed, causing tool call parameters to be truncated. Now all SSE events are properly parsed and queued, ensuring complete tool call arguments in streaming mode. [#1](https://github.com/YumchaLabs/siumai/issues/1)
- **StreamEnd Events** - Fixed missing or incorrect StreamEnd events in streaming responses. StreamEnd events are now properly sent when `finish_reason` is received, with correct finish reason values (Stop, ToolCalls, Length, ContentFilter).
- **Send + Sync Markers** - Added Send + Sync bounds to all capability traits and stream types for proper multi-threading support. [#2](https://github.com/YumchaLabs/siumai/issues/2)

## [0.6.0] - 2025-08-01

### Added

- **Unified Embedding API** - Unified embedding API through `Siumai` client with builder patterns and provider-specific optimizations for OpenAI, Gemini, and Ollama

## [0.5.1] - 2025-07-27

### Added

- **Unified Tracing API** - All provider builders (Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, Groq, xAI) now support tracing methods (`debug_tracing()`, `json_tracing()`, `minimal_tracing()`, `pretty_json()`, `mask_sensitive_values()`)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-07-27

### Added

- **Enhanced Tracing and Monitoring System** - Complete HTTP request/response tracing with security features
  - **Pretty JSON Formatting** - `.pretty_json(true)` enables human-readable JSON bodies and headers

    ```rust
    .debug_tracing().pretty_json(true)  // Multi-line indented JSON
    ```

  - **Sensitive Value Masking** - `.mask_sensitive_values(true)` automatically masks API keys and tokens (enabled by default)

    ```rust
    // Default: "Bearer sk-1...cdef" (secure)
    .mask_sensitive_values(false)  // Shows full keys (not recommended)
    ```

  - **Comprehensive HTTP Tracing** - Automatic logging of request/response headers, bodies, timing, and status codes
  - **Multiple Tracing Modes** - `.debug_tracing()`, `.json_tracing()`, `.minimal_tracing()` for different use cases
  - **UTF-8 Stream Handling** - Proper handling of multi-byte characters in streaming responses
  - **Security by Default** - API keys automatically masked as `sk-1...cdef` to prevent accidental exposure

## [0.4.0] - 2025-06-22

### Added

- **Groq Provider Support** - Added high-performance Groq provider with ultra-fast inference for Llama, Mixtral, Gemma, and Whisper models
- **xAI Provider Support** - Added dedicated xAI provider with Grok models support, reasoning capabilities, and thinking content processing
- **OpenAI Responses API Support** - Complete implementation of OpenAI's Responses API
  - Stateful conversations with automatic context management
  - Background processing for long-running tasks (`create_response_background`)
  - Built-in tools support (Web Search, File Search, Computer Use)
  - Response lifecycle management (`get_response`, `cancel_response`, `list_responses`)
  - Response chaining with `continue_conversation` method
  - New types: `ResponseStatus`, `ResponseMetadata`, `ListResponsesQuery`
  - New trait: `ResponsesApiCapability` for Responses API specific functionality
- Configuration enhancements for Responses API
  - `with_responses_api()` - Enable Responses API mode
  - `with_built_in_tool()` - Add built-in tools (WebSearch, FileSearch, ComputerUse)
  - `with_previous_response_id()` - Chain responses together
- Comprehensive documentation and examples for Responses API usage

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Simplified `ChatStreamEvent` enum for better consistency
  - Unified `ThinkingDelta` and `ReasoningDelta` into single `ThinkingDelta` event
  - Removed duplicate `Usage` event (kept `UsageUpdate`)
  - Removed duplicate `Done` event (kept `StreamEnd`)
  - Reduced from 10 to 7 stream event types while maintaining full functionality
- Enhanced `OpenAiConfig` with Responses API specific fields
- Updated examples to demonstrate Responses API capabilities

### Fixed

- Updated all examples to use new `StreamEnd` event instead of deprecated `Done` event
  - Fixed `simple_chatbot.rs`, `streaming_chat.rs`, and `capability_detection.rs` examples
  - Ensured all streaming examples work with the simplified event structure

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-21

### Added

- `ChatExtensions` trait with convenience methods (ask, translate, explain)
- Capability proxies: `AudioCapabilityProxy`, `EmbeddingCapabilityProxy`, `VisionCapabilityProxy`
- Static string methods (`user_static`, `system_static`) for zero-copy literals
- LRU response cache with configurable capacity
- `as_any()` method for type-safe client casting

### Fixed

- Streaming output JSON parsing errors caused by network packet truncation
- UTF-8 character handling in streaming responses across all providers
- Inconsistent streaming architecture between providers

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Capability access returns proxies directly (no `Result<Proxy, Error>`)
- **BREAKING**: Capability checks are advisory only, never block operations
- Split `ChatCapability` into core functionality and extensions
- Improved error handling with better retry logic and HTTP status handling
- Optimized parameter validation and string processing performance
- Refactored streaming implementations with dedicated modules for better maintainability
- Added line/JSON buffering mechanisms to handle incomplete data chunks
- Unified streaming architecture across OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and Gemini providers

### Removed

- `register_capability()` and `get_capability()` methods
- `with_capability()`, `with_audio()`, `with_embedding()` deprecated methods
- `FinishReason::FunctionCall` (use `ToolCalls` instead)
- Automatic capability warnings

### Added

- Ollama provider support (chat, streaming, embeddings, model management)
- Multimodal support for vision-capable models
