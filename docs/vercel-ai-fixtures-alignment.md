# Vercel AI SDK Fixtures Alignment

This document tracks fixture-driven semantic alignment work against the Vercel AI SDK.
It is intended to be a pragmatic checklist: each item should correspond to a fixture set
plus a test that validates Siumai’s request/response mapping.

## Conventions

- Fixture root: `siumai/tests/fixtures/<provider>/<suite>/...`
- Suites are case-based: `siumai/tests/fixtures/<provider>/<suite>/<case>/...`
- Each suite should include:
  - `request.json` (unified request shape used by the test)
  - `expected_body.json` (provider wire body produced by transformers)
  - `expected_url.txt` (final URL produced by ProviderSpec)
  - `response.json` (provider wire response)
  - `expected_response.json` (unified response produced by transformers)
- Provider-defined tools follow Vercel JSON shape: `{ "type": "provider", "id", "name", "args": { ... } }`
- Tests live in `siumai/tests/*_fixtures_alignment_test.rs` and are feature-gated.

## Google Vertex Imagen (via Vertex provider)

Provider id: `vertex`

### Done

- [x] `imagen-3.x` `:predict` URL routing for `ImageGenerationRequest`
- [x] `ImageEditRequest` support (mask/inpaint) with `model` in URL
- [x] `referenceImages` pass-through (via `extra_params` and typed options)
- [x] Vercel-aligned `referenceImages` shape for editing (no `mimeType`)
- [x] Vercel-aligned provider options allowlist (drops unknown keys)
- [x] Edit without mask (`EDIT_MODE_CONTROLLED_EDITING`)
- [x] Imagen 4 request parameter mapping (preview/fast/ultra family)
- [x] Negative prompt precedence (`request` > `extra_params` > `providerOptions`)
- [x] Vercel-style warning for unsupported `size` (ignored by Vertex Imagen)
- [x] Vercel-style response envelope (`timestamp`, `modelId`, response headers)
- [x] Broaden response extraction variants (`bytesBase64Encoded` vs nested `image.bytesBase64Encoded`)

### In progress

- [x] Fixture-driven alignment tests under `siumai/tests/fixtures/vertex/imagen/*`

### Next

- [ ] Add fixture coverage for future response metadata fields
